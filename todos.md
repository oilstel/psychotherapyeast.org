# PsychotherapyEast.org Website To-Do List

## Logo Redesign
- ✅ Experiment with a thicker line for both shapes and the box in the logo to better match the fonts on the rest of the page.
- ✅ Maintain the option to place an image in the background.
- ✅ Explore the feasibility of allowing control over changing the colors of the background and text, though it's not a critical requirement.

## Clinical Team Pages
- ✅ Create a simple, standardized page for each clinician, featuring an optional headshot and a short bio. Ensure there's a way to include bullet points or dash-type lists.
- ✅ Ensure there's space to include professional logos, which are small but legible, typically 3-5 per clinician. Relevant organizations might include the British Psychoanalytic Council, British Association for Psychotherapy and Counselling, Tavistock Society of Psychotherapists, and the Professional Standards Authority watermark.
- ✅ Provide guidelines for formatting logos to upload and work with the website's color scheme.
- ✅ Allow for some clinical team members to be listed without having an individual page immediately available, catering to members who are yet to qualify.

## Contact Functionality
- ✅ Implement an easy way for visitors to send a quick email, possibly through a form.
- ✅ Place this contact form or link prominently on the front page and also on each subsection page under "What We Do".

## Subsection Pages
- Design and format subsection pages for additional text and information, with the flexibility for Jamie to edit the copy later.

## News Box Feature
- ✅ Consider adding a feature for a little news box to inform visitors about upcoming events and other news.
- ✅ Evaluate how to incorporate this feature without disrupting the simplicity and clarity of the front page.

Remember to stay in close communication with Jamie for feedback and approval as you proceed with these tasks to ensure the website meets their expectations and requirements.
